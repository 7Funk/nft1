            Will be launched later and will be part of ILONSI Shop and Meta
            FluencerÂ´s eco-system. Our vision is that the ILONSI token will be
            used primarily as a means of repaying parts of commissions to
            companies in Turkey, in the event of sales made via influencers
            trough ILONSI Shop. ILONSI token will be used later on
            Meta-Fluncer.com to buy and bid on various products, NFTs and
            prices.
